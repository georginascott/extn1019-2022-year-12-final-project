# EXTN1019 Prototype Demo

This is the template repo for the _Prototype Demo Video_ deliverable. The
template code contains the usual Tone.js starter code you've been working with
for all of Term 3. You should feel free to modify it as necessary to build your
prototype---chat to us in class if you have any questions about how to do that.

Make sure you read through the [assignment
spec](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/extn1019/deliverables/prototype/#specification)
carefully.

Remember that in your fork of this template repo you need to commit & push
- your code (as usual)
- your _prototype-demo_ video file (with either an `.mov`, `.mp4`, or `.mkv` file extension)
