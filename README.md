# EXTN1019 Year 12 Final Project repo

Ok, this is the big one. This repo is the one you'll use from here on in to
develop and submit your [final
project](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/extn1019/deliverables-year-12/03-final-project/).
It's _also_ the repo you'll use to submit your [prototype
demo](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/extn1019/deliverables-year-12/prototype/)
(including the associated video). So it's basically the main repo you'll be
working on from here until the end of this class.

Since there will be (much!) more variation in your final projects than in the
week-to-week lab stuff, it's harder to make a one-size-fits-all template. So you
might have to make changes to this template (e.g. if you want to include
Tone.js). If that's the case, let your teachers know and we can help you out.
